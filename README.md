## General Information
In the commercial buildings, HVAC systems account for approximately 40-50% of total power consumption, out of which 60-66% is utilized in the plant itself. 75-80% of the plant room power consumption is used in HVAC systems. Due to the global energy surge, even a minuscule drop in input power, can largely affect the energy patterns of the premises. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore various cutting edge technologies that include artificial intelligence and machine learning vis-Ã -vis this increasing need.
Currently, the existing solutions rely majorly on rule-based control systems that are based on defined setpoints as set by the operator (Kim et al., 2019). As a result, they lack adaptability to varying conditions and lack understanding of the complex relationships between the various parameters.
The existing solutions use limited training data and preprocessing techniques which directly affect the robustness and the generalization capabilities of the AI models implemented. While some solutions use a single model approach with an absence of a comparative study that evaluates different models including hybrid architectures, the others pose challenges in integrating into the existing control systems.
This research presents a comprehensive experimentation with a large array of algorithms which is aimed at building a predictive model that forecasts and optimizes power consumption of aircooled chillers. Analysis of load profile and outdoor temperature data enables precise forecasting and efficient chiller control, leading to substantial energy savings and environmental benefits. The findings from this research have broad implications for the cooling systems industry, providing valuable insights for policymakers, engineers, and facility managers seeking to enhance energy efficiency and sustainability in their operations.
